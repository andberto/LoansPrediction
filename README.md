# LoansPrediction
The main profit for banks comes from mortgage contracts. A mortgage contract is an agreement in which one party (the lender), in this case the bank, transfers a certain amount of money to the other party (the borrower), and the borrower assumes the obligation to repay the money. However, this type of loan is subject to risks, as the borrower may prove to be unreliable and fail to repay the money. The purpose of the presented project is to classify loan applicants as reliable or not by using Machine Learning models trained to perform binary classification tasks. This project uses supervised learning techniques and is trained on the "Loan_Default.csv" dataset, which contains data on various borrowers collected over time.
